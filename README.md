# ðŸ“š SQL Practice with Node.js

This repository contains my **daily SQL practice**, solved using **Node.js** with MySQL.  
Each question is saved in its own JavaScript file with a **clear format**:
1. Question details at the top (difficulty, concept, table, and task)
2. Node.js code that creates the database, inserts sample data, and runs the query
